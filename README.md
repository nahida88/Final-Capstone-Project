# Final-Capstone-Project
Weather Forecasting using Machine Learning:


In this project, weather is predicted for different cities using machine learning algorithms. The data was collected from the website Kaggle.
It consists of five years (from October 2012 to October 2017) of hourly data of temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, wind direction for 30 cities 
in North America and 6 cities in Israel (each 45000 rows).

It also contains geographical coordinates such as latitude and longitude of all the cities and hourly weather description (sunny, rainy, snowy â€¦). 
Other features such as elevation and season were added later on.

The units of measurements in this study were given careful consideration and were converted whenever needed to be used in formulas and functions. 
For example in the csv files, temperature is reported in kelvin (K) but in the output of the study is shown in degree Celsius (C).

At the end of this notebook, the Appendix section gives additional information on exploratory data Analysis (EDA), hyper-parameter optimization and 
any other extra work that was done during this project.
